# rosetta-shell
A simple data encryption program which was meant to do much more than it did in the end. The part of the backed-up code has been wrote a couple of years ago when I really started learning C/C++, so don't judge.
And yes, I see that I've been using different .cpp files as if they were header ones instead of making an object files and building 'em separately...
